Hey, good to have you here\! I’m ready to dive into whatever’s on your mind—whether it’s something creative, strategic, or just a random chat. What’s your vibe today?

“That looks like Google Maps, but more importantly Google Earth, by which 3D elements can be inserted in, and people can search around the map and interact with these 3D elements to earn points or unlock offers or rewards of that sake, and they can complete quests in that manner as well. So thinking about this experience, phase one being art, right? Phase one focusing on giving people the ability to discover art around the globe, right? And then thinking about how I, as the builder of this platform, can monetize such an experience. One way I've come to my mind so far is to allow people to donate money to the artists on the platform, that way I can get some of the transaction fees. But aside from that, what are some other ways you think I can monetize that?”

So, donations and transaction fees are a good start. Beyond that, you could monetize in ways that tie into engagement and customization. For example, you could offer premium "quest packs" or exclusive areas that unlock with a subscription. You might also partner with brands or galleries to create sponsored quests or branded rewards. Another avenue could be offering users the ability to customize their avatars or map experience through microtransactions. And since you love AI, you could add AI-generated art experiences or personalized recommendations as a premium service. It’s all about layering value on top of the exploration\!

“Okay, so let's say that the next avenue there is communities, right? Let's say we can allow for artists to get donations, right, and then we can enable a community to decide on a regular basis what 3D elements, you know, should go into their ecosystem and present on the map. From that perspective, I could see that being very important for the sponsorships and the end of the table and the galleries and the brands and communities that could leverage such a feature, but now I'm trying to think about a more streamlined way of introducing those people into the fold, meaning like having a way for them to get in and be able to launch what comes to my mind is so far as like them buying a pass, like a digital NFT pass, and then that gives them the ability to launch into the space and have me build out their worlds that people can engage with, right? So that's another way that comes to my mind, but I'm just trying to make it as seamless as possible because what if it's something that's automated, like basically, you know, rewarding people for this being on the app, eventually, yes, you need to have sponsors so the money comes from somewhere else, but something along that lines where people just get rewarded for doing things.”  
01:37

What you’re describing has a lot of potential\! To keep it seamless, think about a tiered system. That NFT pass could be the gateway, unlocking both participation and tools. But streamline onboarding by offering a "starter quest" that teaches users how to engage, while gradually introducing them to community-building.

For monetization, consider a marketplace where communities can commission custom 3D assets—your platform earns a cut. You could also offer premium automation tools: say, AI-driven community curation or personalized quests. Finally, think about seasonal or event-based sponsorships—brands or galleries could pay to feature special quests during big cultural events. In other words, let the community and brands buy into shared storytelling—while you facilitate and take a slice of the value created.

“Yeah, I guess you're right. I mean, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to, I see the long-term play here for sure, but I'm trying to get some quick action and engagement. But maybe it doesn't have to be monetary, right? Engagement can be daily active users. It doesn't have to necessarily be monetary. So thinking about daily active users, maybe the idea of just collecting the art is sticky enough, but what else could be sticky on top of that?”  
00:33

Absolutely, engagement doesn't always need a dollar sign. To keep users coming back, layer in some fun mechanics. You could have daily challenges—like finding a "hidden" piece of art each day—or unlockable badges and achievements that show off their progress. Social features are sticky too—let people form teams or compete on leaderboards for fun. You might add an AR twist—imagine users can place or even "remix" art in their surroundings. Also, you could let them co-create—users could suggest themes for future art or vote on upcoming quests. Basically, make them feel like active participants in the evolving world, not just observers.

“All right, let's resume this conversation. So, I'm thinking about some mini-games that could be played in space that further help the journey of monetizing the game and making it engageable, right? So, I want you to now interview me, now that you have the context, so I can provide you more information on how this app would work. Think about the features that we could be utilizing from a monetization standpoint and from an exploration standpoint.”  
00:38

All right\! Let’s dig in. First up, when players jump into your space, what’s the first kind of interaction or mini-game you imagine that really hooks them in?

“Yes, so when they jump into the space, they can immediately be identified in the location that they're at and they can collect rewards or coin elements that's near them that keeps them engaged and if there's any nearby spots to check out, they can check those out or they can switch to the standard map mode which is pretty much where everybody has access to and they can play mini-games like basically guessing countries or any other way to interact with the world.”  
00:37

So, you’re blending real-world discovery with map-based play—nice\! Now, for these location-based rewards, are you thinking they refresh daily or based on certain events? And when you say mini-games, do you envision them tied to the themes of the community, or are they more universal—like trivia or puzzles?

“So yeah, generally speaking, there can be more universal like trivia or puzzles when you actually enter the map. That's where you can tap, that's where you can find daily sponsored activations where it may be a community for three days or four days or maybe just one day and it rotates out the community or if you go to a different part of the globe, there's different activations there.”  
00:23

Got it\! So, users can hop into universal fun, but if they explore specific areas, they hit time-limited community activations. Now, thinking monetization: when communities sponsor these activations, do you see them paying to feature their content, or would they also contribute prizes? And do you want users to unlock premium features—like maybe boosting their ability to earn or get exclusive activations?

“I think primarily, companies would be more incentivized to provide the rewards than to have their world be locked up behind some type of wall, rather than gaining their community. I think worlds would be down to have some type of participation in this exercise through paying for ads in the space where, you know, you may have a world and you can walk around and you can see your ad in there. So I think for companies, big or small, it presents opportunity, even if you don't have a car, you can come still.”  
00:48

So, you'd let companies make their mark inside the experience. That means you'd be offering them virtual ad placements—maybe a branded space users can explore. And those companies could sponsor tangible rewards—think discounts or collectibles. Now, to keep engagement flowing, how will you keep users curious? Are you thinking about evolving the map—maybe adding seasonal themes or new types of quests over time?

To keep it minimal but sticky, think of a daily "discovery streak." Each day, a user can log in, do one quick task—like finding a new piece of art, answering a simple daily puzzle, or checking in at a spot. The streak builds up over time and could unlock cumulative rewards—maybe unique art pieces or special customization options. No huge build needed—just a rotating, bite-sized daily goal. The key is making it easy to jump in, fun to repeat, and rewarding to keep coming back.

“Got you.”
